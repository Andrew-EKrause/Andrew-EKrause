My name is Andrew, and I am a Computer Science student at the Univeristy of Wisconsin - La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA. I have recently completed a Software Development internship with Kwik Trip, Inc. I am looking forward to more opportunities upon graduating from college! My expected graduation is in December, 2022.

Besides my academic work, I enjoy working on improving my web development skills by creating my own projects and hosting them online. I am planning on creating a simple game using Unity in the future as well as a mobile application.

I am interested in Computer Science topics such as web development and cyber security. I am also interested in game design.
