Software Developer who recently graduated with my bachelor's degree from the Univeristy of Wisconsin - La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA. I currently work as a Software Developer 1 for Kwik Trip, Inc. In my occupation, I utilize technologies such as ASP.NET Core Blazor and Telerik. I am looking forward to building my career with Kwik Trip and exploring all the opportunities they offer! I am also looking into freelance web development as a side-hustle.

Besides my occupational work, I enjoy working on improving my web development skills by creating my own projects and hosting them online. For future projects, I am planning on creating a simple game using Unity as well as making a mobile application.

My main areas of interest in Computer Science include: Web development, cybersecurity, and game design.
Feel free to check out my repos! I have different repositories that implement a variety of concepts in Computer Science such as simple games, data structures, and web applications.
