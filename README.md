My name is Andrew Krause, and I am a Computer Science student at the Univeristy of Wisconsin - La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA. I recently completed a Software Development internship with Kwik Trip Inc this past summer of 2022. In my internship, I utilized technologies such as ASP.NET Core Blazor and Telerik. I am looking forward to more job opportunities upon graduating from college! I am expecting to graduate in December of 2022.

Besides my academic work, I enjoy working on improving my web development skills by creating my own projects and hosting them online. For future projects, I am planning on creating a simple game using Unity as well as making a mobile application.

My main areas of interest in Computer Science include: Web development, cybersecurity, and game design.
Feel free to check out my repos! I have different repositories that implement a variety of concepts in Computer Science such as simple games, data structures, and web applications.
